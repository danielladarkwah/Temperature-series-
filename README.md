# Temperature-series

This notebooks entails the temperature series for the period of 14 days for Boston and San Francisco. The data was cleaned. There is a visualization to show the camparison between the two cities. 

The data was further manipulated to find average speed per height, finding median speed just to test my knowledge and have fun with the data.
